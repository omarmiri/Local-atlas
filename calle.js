/* ---- CALL-E integration: "Ask the Place" first-party FAQs ----
   Local Atlas asks a business a single factual question by phone and turns the
   answer into a dated, first-party FAQ entry other visitors can reuse.

   Three constraints drove the shape of this file:

   1. @call-e/calle is ESM-only ("type": "module", no `require` export) and
      server.js is CommonJS, so the SDK is reached through a lazy dynamic
      import() rather than a top-level require. It is also lazy on purpose:
      a deploy without CALLE_API_KEY must still boot and serve the map.
   2. Calls take 30-90 s. Holding an HTTP request open that long dies to
      Render's proxy timeout, so /api/ask-place returns immediately and the
      result arrives by webhook, with polling as the fallback.
   3. Webhook deliveries are NOT signed — the SDK's webhooks.verify() is
      deprecated and documented as legacy-only. A POST to our webhook URL is
      therefore untrusted input: we take only the call id from it and re-read
      the authoritative record from the API before storing anything.

   Call credits are finite, so every path that can dial is rate-limited,
   deduplicated, and budget-capped, and CALLE_DRY_RUN=1 exercises the whole
   flow without dialling. */

/* Render's dashboard accepts hyphens in variable names, and the key is deployed
   there as CALL-E-API-KEY — a name no shell can export, so `process.env.X`
   dot-access can never reach it. Read every CALL-E setting under both
   spellings rather than depending on which one someone typed. */

   Set CALLE_GOAL_ID to route live calls through a published Goal instead of
   the one-off Calls API. The only reason to want this is the voice: per the
   spec, "region, callee locale, and runtime profile come from the published
   Goal", and there is no voice field on CreateCallRequest at all.

   It is a switch rather than a migration because the trade is real. GoalRun is
   `additionalProperties: false` over {object, id, goal_id, run_id, run_spec,
   status, result, error, created_at, completed_at} — no transcript, no
   summary, no attempts, and `run_id` is documented as correlation-only. So a
   Goal buys a fixed accent and costs the call log, and it moves the call
   script out of this file and into the dashboard, where it is neither

       live calls, so they need two separate rules. First the agent waited past

       result is built after the call from the transcript; it never needs to be
       spoken, and speaking it makes the agent sound like it is talking about
       the person rather than to them. */

    `13. If you reach voicemail, an automated menu, or a disconnected line, end the call without leaving a message.`,

   of publish() can tell a simulated call from a real one, which is the point:
   the FAQ panel gets built and demoed against real-shaped data, and no fake
